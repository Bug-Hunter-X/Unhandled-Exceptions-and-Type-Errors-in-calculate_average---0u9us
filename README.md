This repository contains a Python function `calculate_average()` that demonstrates common errors related to unhandled exceptions and type errors.  The function aims to calculate the average of a list of numbers. However, it fails when given an empty list or a list containing non-numeric elements.  The `bug.py` file shows the flawed implementation, while `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected and robust version. This example highlights the importance of input validation and handling potential errors in Python functions.
